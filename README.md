# gameTicTac
assessment
instruction to run this game
1) You must be installed xampp or wamp on your computer
2)Turn on Apache
3) Take folder contain all codes, paste in C:\xampp\htdocs if you use xampp OR C:\wamp\www if you use wamp
4) Open browse and write in URL, localhost/gameTicTac.
after that instruction game will run, no need to specify file to run first, because I used index.php as default 
file will run first once you press enter after to write localhost/gameTicTac.
Thanks!
